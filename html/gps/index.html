<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic tags help distinguish and organize different elements of the html documents.  This is helpful for not only coming back to your code but also for readers.  nav and article seem particularly helpful as their intents are clear and sound pretty consistent.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

I believe the browser will load whatever is in the head tag first and then lead the body tag.  Usually style sheets, javascripts, and other document wide elements are located in the head.  From there individual elements in the body are rendered.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

The main thing I learned is that you can create snippets.  I was definitely impressed by the ability to make snippets.  Considering all I've learned so far is html and basic CSS I'm not sure what snippets I'll make in the future, but the tool seems so convenient I feel it is inevitable.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

I think the most challenging part is understanding best practices for different tags.  At this point because I've done so little work in HTML, all explanation of semantic tags is taken at face value.  I don't have experience seeing them used in the wild.  However because their different uses and relative importance are on my radar now I'll definitely be aware of how they're being used as I go forward.
