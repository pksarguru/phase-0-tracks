Release 1:

    2.  Linux is open source, meaning it's decentralized, being developed by people all over the world and not controlled by a single entity.

    3.  VPS is a virtual computer that can be used to run programs or receive/send HTTP requests.  VPS allow more control over the setup of your server, rather than having to share servers with other websites.  The use of VPS servers also allows easy sacability when needed.  One can simply acquire more VPS space rather than having to upgrade a physical server.

    4. The root user contains privileges that a user doesn't.  Therefore there is a basic level of security built into the system with the division of powers.  If a particular user is comprised, it won't compromise the entire system.
