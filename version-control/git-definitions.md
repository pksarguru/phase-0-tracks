# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a process that saves changes to files/folders from different users and allows you to track/merge those changes onto an overall document.  It becomes useful not only to allow multiple users to collaboration on a single project but also to help keep track of those collaborations.  Version control can time stamp when changes were made and what exactly was changed.  Therefore if bugs are found, it can become easier to track their origins.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is essentially a parallel copy of your repository you can create.  Branching allows you to work on a specific feature without affecting the master code base.  You can create a branch to work on a specific feature and then merge it back into the master branch once it's finished.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is when you're uploading a file back to your repository and a record is kept of it.  A commit message is essentially the manual messages you're using to tag that message.  A good commit message describes the changes you've actually made in a sufficient, yet specific, manner.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - Merge conflict occurs when you attempt to merge a branch of a repository.  The conflicts can be different: disparate edits of an identical code element or an element being deleted from one of the branches.
